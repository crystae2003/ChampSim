# OVERVIEW
Champsim is a trace-based simulator designed to model the performance of modern microprocessors, specifically focusing on cache hierarchy and branch prediction.
It allows researchers and developers to evaluate and improve the performance of various microarchitectural components.


This repository documents the improvement of Champsim in two distinct phases:
Phase 1: Champsim Preliminary
Phase 2: Champsim IPC Challenge
The report outlines the strategies employed to enhance the IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) and the resulting improvements achieved.

# RESULTS
The implementation of strategies (mentioned in the report) led to a substantial improvement in IPC. The specific enhancements in each area contributed to an overall IPC improvement of 80.335%.

# CONCLUSION

The two-phase approach allowed for a systematic improvement in the Champsim simulator. The preliminary phase helped in identifying key areas of improvement, while the IPC challenge phase focused on implementing targeted optimizations. The result was an impressive 80% increase in IPC, demonstrating the effectiveness of the strategies applied.
